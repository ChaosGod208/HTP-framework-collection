# HTP Framework Collection

Collection of 11 foundational frameworks from the HTP series — free, public domain blueprints covering game design balancing, immortality mechanics, grief resolution, reflective love architecture, real-life RPG gamification, and more.

All content is **public domain** — use, fork, modify, build upon freely. No attribution required, but linking back is appreciated.

## The 11 Frameworks in this Repo

1. **relative-defense.md**  
   Core relative defense scaling law — fixes late-game power creep and imbalance across genres.

2. **armor-layer.md**  
   Post-mitigation armor layering system — adds meaningful depth to defense without breaking scaling.

3. **projectile-life.md**  
   Projectile HP mechanic — balances ranged vs melee, increases skill expression and counterplay.

4. **rollback-immortality.md**  
   Rollback-based immortality blueprint — ensures continuity of self without copy-loss issues.

5. **continuity-resurrection.md**  
   True continuity resurrection — preserves identity and relational bonds, no "clone" dystopia.

6. **consciousness-extraction.md**  
   Sovereign consciousness extraction — ethical, reversible pattern extraction for immortality tech.

7. **universal-grief-resolution.md**  
   Framework to resolve universal grief — heals relational and existential loss in post-mortal societies.

8. **reflective-love-codex.md**  
   Reflective love architecture — sustainable multi-partner dynamics with mutual evolution and no deception.

9. **real-life-rpg.md**  
   Real-life RPG gamification system — turns daily life into progression loop with stats, quests, and meaningful dopamine.

10. **anticipation-stress-dopamine-mechanics.md**  
    Mechanics to manage anticipation stress and dopamine in real-life and virtual progression systems.

11. **dopamine-mechanics-real-life-rpg-integration.md**  
    Integration of dopamine mechanics into real-life RPG — balanced reward loops for sustainable growth.

## Why This Collection?
These frameworks fix root problems in game design (scaling, balance, late-game boredom), immortality tech (continuity, grief), love/relationships (sustainable harem/reflection), and real-life progression (meaningful dopamine).  
Public domain → no gate, no paywall — anyone can use to raise baseline quality in their domain.

Fork, build, share. Let's flood the world with better systems.

If you create something using these (game, mod, app, essay), drop a link in issues — chaos loves company.

Made with raw insight & zero corporate fluff.
